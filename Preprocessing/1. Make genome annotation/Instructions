#This is your guide for making a suitable genome annotation file for RNA velocity pre-processing.
#Step 1: download the genome annotation file for your chosen species in GTF format
#Step 2: run the first part (Part 1) of the EditAnnotation.R code, adapting it to the format of your species
#Step 3: add the following (adapted to your species) to your output GFF3 file:

##gff-version 3
#!genome-build GRCh38.p13
#!genome-version GRCh38
#!genome-date 2013-12
#!genome-build-accession GCA_000001405.28
#!genebuild-last-updated 2021-03

#Step 4: Run the following in bash (change to a suitable directory)

cd /media/claired/DATADRIVE2/FEAST/Annotation
gt gff3 -retainids -addintrons Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.104_Edited.gff3 > Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.104_Edited_IntronsAdded.gff3

#AG has found that the above genometools command doesn't work with multiple sources. To unify them in bash, use the awk command.
#Line nine is chosen here because its the first instance of a source inconsistency: 
awk -F'\t' '
    BEGIN {OFS=FS}
    $9 ~ /ID=/ {
        match($9, /ID=([^;]+)/, id);
        if (!(id[1] in source)) source[id[1]] = $2;
        $2 = source[id[1]];
    }
    { print }
' Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.113_Edited.gff3 > Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.113_Edited_unified_sources.gff3

#Step 5: Run Part 2 of the R code 

#Step 6: add the following line to the final gff3 file
##gff-version 3

Step 7: sort the gff3 file

cd /media/claired/DATADRIVE1/Annotation/
gt gff3 -sort -retainids Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.104_IntronsFinal.gff3  > Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.104_IntronsFinalSorted.gff3

Step 8: add the following lines to the final GTF file:

##gff-version 2
#!genome-build GRCh38.p13
#!genome-version GRCh38
#!genome-date 2013-12
#!genome-build-accession GCA_000001405.28
#!genebuild-last-updated 2021-03
