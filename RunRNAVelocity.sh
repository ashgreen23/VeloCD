#parameters dor RNA velocity python code:
#1 is the number of neighbours/perplexity
#2 loction of everything
#3 spliced file
#4 unspliced file
#5 main metadata file with samples as first columan and Group as second ("Group" must be second column name) - used for colouts
#6 second metadata file of additional info - used for markers and/or as additional thing to look at trabsition probabilities over
#7 PCA variation based feature selection: NoPCAVar (do not run) or PCAVar (run this analysis)
#8 location of output dir (to be added to the end of the second parameter
#9 Do basic correlation coefficient based feature selection? NoCoorelationCoeff (do not run) or CoorelationCoeff (run this)
#10 apply scaling? (for vlm.calculate_embedding_shift* functions) False (do not do this) or True (do this)
#11 distance parameter for UMAP (currently set to the default)
#12 metric method used for UMAP parameter (currently set the default)
#13 location of the additional (R) code required for the transition probability work
#14 the "type" of (grouptype) first metadata i.e. are these "strings" (classes) or "integers" (numeric timepoints)
#15 generate gif versions of UMAP3D, transiton probability scatterplots and 3D PCA? True (run this) or False (do not run this)
#16 true is "manyfeatures" - basically if your second ematadat file has useful classes to predict on then put as "True"
#17 "strings": type of second feature is the final paramater
#18 true is Randomsampling
#19 confidence interval calculation? (using first metadata: 7)) - "True" or "False"
#20 number of iterations for CI calculation - always an integer
#21 run tsne analsysi? "True" or "False"
#22 run UMAP analysis? "True" or "False" - second command line argument for the shell script
#23 run 3d umap? "True" or "False" - if false then it will just run the 2d umap, has to be used in conjuncture witha true argument 24 - third commend line argument for the shell script
#24 number of principal components to use for the pca! def: "3"  must be an integer defines how many PCs are given to tSNE
#25 beginning of the range for the transtion probability cloest number of neighbours value
#26 the end of a range for the transtion probability cloest number of neighbours value i.e. "2" at #27 and "11" at #28 would generate values between 2-10
#27 the skip i.e. betwen 27 and 28 - 2 would be 2,4,6, 1 would be 2,3,4
#28 specific output folder name
#29 Whether to shape the points by the metadata
#30 number of pca components to plot i.e. first "2" or first "3"
#31 colour map
#32 fate maps pca plots
#33 3d pca fate maps
#34 use the second metadata feature for prediction - yes or no
#35 user threshold for prediction
